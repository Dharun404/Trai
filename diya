Intro: 
Being an extrovert has always been part of who I am. From my school days to now as a professional, I’ve built connections and friendships easily. But often, I’ve faced situations where people took advantage of my nature, using me as a shield to protect themselves from blame or pressure. This made me think about how to deal with such ‘social attacks’—situations where our personality or actions make us vulnerable to exploitation.
 
Why Are You Targeted?
In college, there were group projects where I would often end up handling most of the work because others assumed I’d step in to ensure success. In my workplace, similar dynamics happen—my friendly nature leads others to push their own issues onto me.
 
Strategies to Overcome Social Attack:
Set Boundaries (Politely but Firmly):
In a workplace meeting, a colleague once tried to make me take responsibility for an unresolved task. I responded calmly, ‘I think this involves all of us, not just me. Let’s tackle it together.
 
Develop Self-Awareness:
Am I constantly being made the scapegoat? Are others relying on my goodwill to avoid their responsibilities?"
 
Communicate Assertively:
I feel uncomfortable being the one to handle this task alone. Can we discuss a better way to divide responsibilities?"
 
Strengthen Emotional Resilience:
Once, when I was blamed for a delay in a team project, I calmly pointed out the timelines and tasks assigned to everyone. This shifted the focus back to collective accountability.
 
Takeaways:
People may target your strengths, but those same strengths can also be your defense. Be the bright, extroverted person you are, but don’t hesitate to stand your ground and prioritize your well-being.
